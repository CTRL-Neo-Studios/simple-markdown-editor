# Simple Markdown Editor

_As it turns out, making a simple markdown editor is not simple at all._

Simple Markdown Editor is my pathetic attempt at trying to replicate Obsidian's fabulous WYSIWYG Markdown Editor using CodeMirror.
It's currently using an implementation based on [segphault/codemirror-rich-markdoc](https://github.com/segphault/codemirror-rich-markdoc)'s
WYSIWYG MarkDoc-Based CM6 editor, and I'll switch the MarkDoc Implementation to [remark/remarkjs] once I get the markdown editing done.
